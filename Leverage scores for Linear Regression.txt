The leverage scores are defined as the influence the dependent variable of a datapoint has on the predicted value for itself.
This can be written as: d y_hat/dy
For linear regression this value has a closed form expression.

w = (X'*X)^(-1)*X'*y
and 
y_hat = X*w = X*(X'*X)^(-1)*X'*y
y_hat = H*y where H = X*(X'*X)^(-1)*X'

and the leverage scores is then:
H_ii = X_i*(X'*X)^(-1)*X_i

By sampling from a distribution proportional to these leverage scores the most important points are sampled first 
and the accuracy of the resulting model is greater compared to just sampling uniformly from the datapoints.

Also notice that H is independant of y so this can be done unsupervised and be a method that can replace active learning.
